# Flight Price Analysis & Visualization
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a flight price dataset. The primary goal is to uncover key factors that influence flight ticket prices through comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and insightful visualizations.
Key Activities
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized data formats across the dataset.

Feature Engineering:

Extracted Date, Month, and Year from the Date_of_Journey.

Parsed Dep_Time and Arrival_Time into distinct hour and minute components.

Converted categorical Total_Stops into numerical values.

Calculated Total_Duration_Minutes for a consistent measure of flight duration.

Created time-of-day categories like Morning, Afternoon, and Evening for departure and arrival.

Data Visualization: Generated a variety of plots to explore relationships between variables:

Price Distribution: Histogram to view the spread of ticket prices.

Price vs. Airline/Stops/Departure Period: Boxplots to compare price distributions across different categories.

Price vs. Duration: Scatter plot to identify the relationship between flight duration and price.

Correlation Matrix: A heatmap to visualize the correlation between all numerical features.
